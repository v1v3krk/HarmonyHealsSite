We know that blogs can always improve, so we are receptive to any comments and feedback you give. That being said, let us get started.</p><p>This blog is mainly going to be covering issues across the world and what we can do within our local community to help out those in need. Primarily, we will be focusing on the issues UNICEF tackles across the globe, such as global health and immunization, refugees, water, sanitation, child marriage, and many more pressing issues. Although Harmony Heals has brought a lot of awareness towards medical problems, we hope to expand ourselves and shed light to these other issues as well. We feel that it’s extremely important for the general public and especially our members to have an understanding of what is going on around the world. Sometimes we take our current situation as granted and do not realize the opportunity that we have been given in our lives. Through these posts, we hope to bring a greater sense of awareness and also educate individuals regarding these global problems.</p><p>Each blog post will focus on a specific issue, and explain the situation in detail through facts, statistics, and witness accounts to add depth to our blogs. We want to make sure what we say is factual, so we will also be citing sources that you can use for your own research. We will also include different ways you can help to fight for these causes through petitions, donation links, and organizations that are working toward that specific cause.</p><p>We will also try to keep the issues somewhat current and relevant in order to explain what’s going on in the world as it happens. We recognize that there are a lot of things that we don't have full clarity on, but that’s exactly why this blog was created. We want to make sure everyone is informed on current affairs and how they relate to these pressing issues. In addition, we aim to keep these posts moderate in regards to length and bold certain key points so that it is also easy to skim through the content.</p><p>Finally, as we mentioned before, we will be open to any suggestions that you may have. If you have any ideas for topics we could cover, ways we can share information, or anything at all, make sure to contact us through email or Instagram DM.</p><p>We know that helping towards these issues can seem far-fetched, but the first step to solve any problem is through understanding the situation around and bringing awareness. That’s exactly what we want to do with this blog, so we can all make a positive impact on our world.</p><p>Stay tuned,</p><p>Harmony Heals Team<br /></p>",
