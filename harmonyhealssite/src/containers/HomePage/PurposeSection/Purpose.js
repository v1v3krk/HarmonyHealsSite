As a result, we are strong believers in the mission of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, and chose to support them to bring awareness and collect funds for their lifesaving work in health and immunization. UNICEF has helped save more childrenâ€™s lives than any other humanitarian organization by providing health care and immunizations, safe water and sanitation, nutrition, education, emergency relief, and more.</p>
